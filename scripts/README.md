4. Set up monitoring and analytics
5. Implement backup procedures

### Strategy 2: Staging Environment
**Best for**: Testing before production release
**Steps**:
1. Use test/development API keys
2. Create separate Supabase project for staging
3. Test all functionality thoroughly
4. Migrate successful configuration to production

### Strategy 3: MVP Quick Launch
**Best for**: Getting a functional site live quickly
**Steps**:
1. Use development/test keys initially
2. Configure basic authentication
3. Use Resend.dev for email (no domain setup)
4. Upgrade to production services later
