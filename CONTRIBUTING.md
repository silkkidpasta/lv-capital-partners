## üìã Development Guidelines

### Branch Naming Convention

- `feature/feature-name` - New features
- `bugfix/bug-description` - Bug fixes
- `hotfix/urgent-fix` - Urgent production fixes
- `docs/documentation-update` - Documentation changes
- `refactor/component-name` - Code refactoring

### Commit Message Convention

We follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) specification:

```
type(scope): description

[optional body]

[optional footer]
```

**Types:**
- `feat`: New feature
- `fix`: Bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation changes
- `style`: Code style changes (formatting, etc.)
- `refactor`: Code refactoring
- `test`: Adding or updating tests
- `chore`: Maintenance tasks

**Examples:**
```
feat(dashboard): add portfolio analytics chart
fix(auth): resolve login redirect issue
docs(readme): update installation instructions
```

### Code Style

- Use TypeScript for all new code
- Follow the existing code style (enforced by Biome)
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Add JSDoc comments for complex functions
- Keep functions small and focused

### Component Guidelines

1. **File Organization:**
   ```
   src/components/
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ui/              # Reusable UI components
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ dashboard/       # Dashboard-specific components
   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ verification/    # Feature-specific components
   ```

2. **Component Structure:**
   ```typescript
   interface ComponentProps {
     // Define props with TypeScript
   }

   export function Component({ prop1, prop2 }: ComponentProps) {
     // Component logic
     return (
       // JSX
     );
   }
   ```

3. **Styling:**
   - Use Tailwind CSS classes
   - Follow the existing design system
   - Use CSS modules for complex styles if needed

### TypeScript Guidelines

- Avoid `any` types - use proper type definitions
- Use interfaces for object types
- Export types that might be reused
- Use generic types when appropriate

### Testing

While we don't have comprehensive tests yet, when adding tests:

- Place unit tests next to the component: `Component.test.tsx`
- Use descriptive test names
- Test user interactions, not implementation details
- Mock external dependencies

## üêõ Reporting Bugs
